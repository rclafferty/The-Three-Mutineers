# The Three Mutineers

This game was created as part of the Chillennium Game Jam 2019 by the team UNL Alpha Squad. It requires three players to play, with Player 1 and Player 2 using Xbox controllers and Player 3 using a keyboard and mouse.

## Character Overview

All three players must work together (or not) to solve the puzzles in each of the two levels to defeat the guards, get keys to open doors, and save the king.

- Player 1: Lock Pick -- Helps open doors
- Player 2: Super Strength -- Moves boulder without getting hurt
- Player 3: Technical Support -- Helps open ammo door

Working together may make problems easier to solve, but you can get a higher reward if you win without the aid of your comrades.
